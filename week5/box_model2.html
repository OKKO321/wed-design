      <h1>The Black Forest</h1>
      <p id="p1">
        The Black Forest is a large forested mountain range in the state of
        Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg in southwest Germany, bounded by the Rhine Valley to
        the west and south and close to the borders with France and Switzerland.
        It is the source of the Danube and Neckar rivers. Its highest peak is
        the Feldberg with an elevation of 1,493 metres (4,898 ft) above sea
        level. Roughly oblong in shape, with a length of 160 kilometres (100
        miles) and breadth of up to 50 km (30 mi), it has an area of about 6,009
        km2 (2,320 sq mi). Historically, the area was known for forestry and the
        mining of ore deposits, but tourism has now become the primary industry,
        accounting for around 300,000 jobs. There are several ruined military
        fortifications dating back to the 17th century.
