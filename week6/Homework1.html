        <h1>Horus Heresy</h1>
        <p>
          The Horus Heresy, sometimes referred to poetically as the "Age of
          Darkness" and originally known in its immediate aftermath as the Great
          Heresy War, was a galaxy-spanning civil war that consumed the worlds
          of Mankind for 9 Terran years. Its outbreak marked the end of the
          Emperor of Mankind's Great Crusade to reunite the scattered colony
          worlds of Humanity in the Milky Way Galaxy under a single government
          and the beginning of the current Age of the Imperium. The Horus Heresy
          is in many ways the founding event of the Imperium of Man as it now
          exists. <br> <br>

          The civil war began following the corruption by the Ruinous
          Powers of Chaos of the Imperial Warmaster Horus Lupercal, the primarch
          of the Sons of Horus Legion and the most beloved genetic son of the
          Emperor. The Chaos Gods fed Horus' innate ambition and sense of
          betrayal by the Emperor until he turned upon his father and sought to
          claim the Imperium for his own. <br> <br>

          Horus convinced half of the other
          primarchs and Space Marine Legions, as well as large swathes of the
          Imperial Army and the forces of the ancient Mechanicum, to turn
          Traitor alongside him and unleash a cataclysmic attempt to conquer the
          galaxy in his name.
